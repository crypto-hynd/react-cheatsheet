## Higher Order Component(HOC)
Higher Order Component(HOC)isapattern in
React for reusing the logic of one component by
transforming it into another one with additional
enhancements.

This technique is similar to decorators in python
programming language.It can be used for both-
class and functional components.

Ipersonally use most of the times custom hooks,
however hoc are still used in 2022 and it's good to
know how they work
